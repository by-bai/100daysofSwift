### Learning Points
1. Variables
- read "var" as "create a new variable"

2. Strings and Integers
- swift is a type-safe language: every variable must be of one specific type.
- when you create a variable and assign a type of data to it, the variable will always have that one specific type. 

3. Multi-line Strings
- standard strings do not contain any line breaks
- multi-line strings makes code readable for huge blocks of texts

4. Doubles and Booleans

5. String Interpolation
- dynamic data instead of static
- a way of injecting custom data into strings at runtime
- can place any kind of data: strings, integers, booleans, etc

6. Constants
- let keyword creates constants 
- values cannot be changed once set

7. Type annotations
- example of when to use type annotation: 
- create a double variable without having to constantly write ".0" everywhere
- var percentage: Double = 99

- create variable of a specific type without setting its value 
- var name: String
