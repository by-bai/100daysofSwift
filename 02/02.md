### Learning Points

1. Arrays
- can be as large or as small as you want
- can freely add/remove/rearrange items
- retains order, can contain duplicates


2. Sets
- unordered, random order
- all items must be unique
- optimized for fast retrieval due to random order as opposed to array - needs to check every single item until it's found


3. Tuples
- fixed size: can't add/remove items
- can change the value of items but can't change the type of items in a tuple
- can access items in a tuple using numerical positions/by naming them


4. Arrays vs sets vs tuples
- tuple: specific, fixed collection of related values where each item has a precise position or name
- set: collection of values that must be unique, or check whether a specific item is in there quickly
- arrays: (most common) collection of values that can contain duplicates, or the order of items matters


5. Dictionaries
- access items using anything you want
- key-value pair
- like sets, optimized for fast retrieval


6. Dictionary default values
- read value with a key that doesnt exist: returns nil
- can provide the dictionary with a default value to use if we request a missing key


7. Creating empty collections


8. Enumerations
- enums are a way of defining groups of related values in a way that makes them easier to use


9. Enum associated values
- enums can store associated values attached to each case
- attaches additional information to enums so they can represent more nuanced data

10. Enum raw values
- Swift automatically assigns each case a number starting from 0
- we can assign one or more cases a specific value and Swift will generate the rest
